Idle Miner Bot

This bot is designed to be left alone with an idle miner mine on the main island (currently known support for the Coal and Gold mine. No other mines have been tested)

To run (my way):
	Open with Jetbrains PyCharm (The IDE I am using)
	add configurations --> Script Path: path\to\main.py
	file --> settings (or ctrl+alt+s) --> project idle_miner_bot --> python interpreter --> Python Interpreter: path\to\python.exe (looks like C:\Users\Username\file\path\python3.9.exe
	Run: (shift+f10 or ctrl+shift+f10) or click green triangle in the top right
